## Hello, I'm Morgan Olivia Evans! 👋


I am a 2025 computer science graduate from UC Irvine with experience in embedded systems, high-performance computing, and earth system science. My journey has taken me through hands-on roles at NASA, KPFF, SCEC, and ACCESS, and I’m always eager to keep learning, building creatively, and contributing to impactful real-world systems.

### Featured Projects

#### Scientific Computing and Visualization
  
- 🌍 **NASA GEOS Benchmarking** – Analyzed MPI and I/O performance for the NASA Center for Climate Simulation's Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) climate model on several clusters 
- 🏙️ **KPFF Structural Visualization Tool** – Capstone project using Godot and OpenSees to render 3D displacement and DCR results
- ❄️ **ACCESS GPU Climate Optimization** – Reduced ice-sheet model runtime by 10% using kernel concurrency and profiling tools
- 🌱 **SCEC Computational Seismic Modeling** – Built, visualized, and analyzed synthetic earthquake simulations using SW4 on the Rockfish HPC cluster  

#### Embedded Systems

- 🎮 **Audio Feedback Device** – ATmega32-based device with sound detection and visual feedback system to encourage quieter gaming  
- 🐱 **Motion-Activated Motorized Cat Toy** – ESP32-based device with accelerometer, LED, speaker, motor, and 3D-printed housing  
- 🦺 **CON-E: Conical Ocular and Navigation – Explorer** – Vision-enabled robotic traffic cone using Raspberry Pi and ESP32-S3 to autonomously track orange objects with onboard mobility, audio, and LED control
